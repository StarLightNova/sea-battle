## üó∫Ô∏è¬†PlayerMap

The main map of the game. The whole map will be assembled (in the game) by 2 maps. 1 map for 1 player.

| Type | Struct |
| --- | --- |

| Value members | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TheMap | It contains the key to the row and number as column. | map[string][]string |
| Width | The width of the battle map. It is 10 by default game. | const int |
| Height | A height is the same as width. | const int |
| fillPureMap(TheMap) | Fills TheMap (with ‚Äù ‚Äù (space)).  |  |
| ShadowMap | Map for the opponent to hide the ships from each other. | map[string][]string |

| Functions | Description | Return type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Constructor | Creates a map according to the width and height. By default all the values inside of the map is ‚Äú ‚Äù (space). |  |
| String [interface] | It will show the current state of the map. It is going to show the all variables inside the PlayerMap for now. | string |
| GetDamage(string, int) | Accepts string and int coordinates as the parameter and damages with ‚ÄúX‚Äù if the current coordinate has ‚ÄúS‚Äù, if not puts ‚ÄúM‚Äù. |  |
| GetCell(string, int) | Accepts string and int coordinates as the parameter and returns the value of that cell. | string |
| PlaceUnit(string, int) | Accepts string and int coordinates as the parameter and places the value ‚ÄúS‚Äù to the PlayerMap. |  |
| GetLetterCoordinates() | Depends on the Width constant, default values are from ‚ÄúA‚Äù - ‚ÄúJ‚Äù. | [Width]string |
| MapPrinter(PlayerMap) | Returns the map in string format. | string |
| isDefeated | Check‚Äôs the player‚Äôs map, if non ‚ÄúS‚Äù occurs it returns ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù, otherwise ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù | bool |
| emptyRow | 10 empty strings. (‚Äù ‚Äú) | [Width]string |
